    "In this project a single gradebook class is responsible for updating grades, loading from/saving to a file, and calculating the letter grade. This violates the single responsibility principle. In my solution I create 2 separate classes for memory resident updates and file access, and a function for applying the grading scale.\n",
    "The Python documentation on files is here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files \n",
    "The grading scale has another problem, any time the scale needs to be modified I must modify the class, violating open/closed. This can be solved by using a list of tuples of the form (start, end, letter). When a grading scale object is initialized this list is provided, and rather than an if-elif block to pick the letter grade, we write a loop to check the intervals. The first matching interval returns its letter grade.\n",
    "Liskov substitution\n",
    "https://repl.it/@rock/AnnualMixedDeveloper#main.py \n",
    "This is the canonical example for Liskov substitution. A Square class is derived from Rectangle. All of Rectangle's methods are either used by Square or overridden to make sense for Square. The mutators for square need to update both length and width, since that is the defining property of a square. However, doing this violates a somewhat esoteric invariant of Rectangles: in a Rectangle, if you double the length, the area is doubled. In a Square, if you double the length, the area is quadrupled.\n",
    "How can we get code reuse (primarily from area) without using inheritance?\n",
    "Have a Square use it's own init, with setSide and getSide. But instead of a side length for its datamember, have each Square contain a Rectangle. Changing a side will cause both the length and width of the inner rectangle to change, and Square can just return its rectangle's area as its own. Since square is not derived from rectangle, the fact that it quadruples area when side length is doubled does not violate Liskov substitution."
